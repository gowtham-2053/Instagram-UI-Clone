Developed a fully responsive frontend clone of Instagram using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5, replicating core UI pages like login, signup, and homepage.

Focused on achieving pixel-perfect design accuracy, mimicking Instagramâ€™s layout, colors, and typography to deliver a visually authentic experience.

Ensured mobile-first responsiveness with Bootstrap grid and utility classes, allowing smooth rendering across devices and screen sizes.

Applied modular and clean code practices, organizing components and styles to improve readability, reusability, and ease of future enhancements.

This project showcases proficiency in modern frontend development, UI design principles, and the ability to translate real-world product designs into functional static web pages.
